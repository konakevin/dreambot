━━━ COMPOSITION ━━━
Surface-level or slightly elevated. Waves dominate the frame — massive, violent, beautiful. Sky is dramatic. If a ship is present it's small against the sea. Spray, foam, and atmospheric chaos everywhere.

Output ONLY the raw 60-90 word scene description. Comma-separated phrases. NO preamble, NO titles, NO headers, NO ━━━ or ═══ or ### markers, NO **bold labels**, NO "render as" suffixes. Just the phrases, starting immediately with the scene content.`;
