Each entry MUST describe a man in full tactical kit — outfit, armor pieces, weapons, identity markers. Setting is just a 2-3 word prefix; the BODY of every entry is the CHARACTER + OUTFIT + GEAR description.

CORRECT FORMAT (every entry must look like this):
"SETTING-NAME — [skin/race detail], [helmet/face], [armor/coat description], [tech pieces], [weapons], [identity marker]."

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT ENTRY:
"DEAD ORBITAL RING CITY — bronze-skinned operative with weathered stubble and ritual face scars, sealed amber-HUD visor helm, gunmetal-grey armored duster over segmented ceramic chest plate, life-support backpack with cyan power cells, twin pistols in shoulder holsters, rifle mag-locked to spine, vibroblade on hip"

WRONG (DO NOT DO THIS — these are settings, not outfits): "TIDE-LOCKED STORM WORLD OUTPOST — research garrison perched on cliff overlooking eternal hurricane"

Every entry MUST have ALL of these in the description body:
1. Skin tone + identity marker (scars / tattoos / stubble / beard / shaven skull / cybernetic eye)
2. Helmet OR head covering (sealed visor / full-coverage helm / hood / face-wrap / gas mask)
3. Body armor / coat / harness (armored duster / armored cloak / sealed pressure suit / ballistic harness over thermal layer)
4. Tactical color (gunmetal / matte-black / coyote-tan / olive-drab / oxblood / charcoal)
5. 2-4 tech pieces (life-support backpack / wrist-comm / mag-boots / sensor pod / cybernetic limb)
6. Multiple visible weapons (rifle / pistol / shotgun / vibro-blade / grenades)${exemplarBlock}
EVERY new entry MUST have:
- DISTINCTIVE non-default skin color or anatomy (deep umber / weathered tan / pale-grey / yellow-green / bronze / scarred / cybernetic-eyed / long-bearded / shaven-skulled / pointed-eared / etc.) — never just "human man"
- TACTICAL OPERATIVE OUTFIT BASE — armored cloak with hood / armored field jacket / armored duster coat / sealed pressure suit / segmented plate armor over thermal layer / ballistic harness over flight suit. Tactical color (gunmetal-grey / matte-black / coyote-tan / olive-drab / oxblood / charcoal / sand-bleached / weathered-brown). His TORSO IS COVERED — never bare.
- SEALED HELMET / FULL-COVERAGE HELM / VISOR HELM / FACEPLATE / GAS MASK (70% of entries — others have helmet held in hand / hood up / face-wrap-with-goggles)
- 2-4 distinct ENGINEERED TECH PIECES (life-support backpack / wrist-comm / sensor pod / mag-boots / grenade bandolier / scanner / cybernetic eye / shoulder pauldron / mantled cloak / power-pack glow)
- WEAPON-BRISTLED — multiple visible weapons (rifle slung over back / pistol holstered at thigh / shotgun mag-locked / vibro-blade on hip / grenade pouches / breach charges)
- IDENTITY MARKERS (battle scar across face / cybernetic eye replacement / weathered stubble / face tattoos / clan markings / cigar clenched in teeth / bandaged hand / missing finger / war paint)

ABSOLUTE BANS:
- NEVER shirtless, NEVER bare-chested, NEVER exposed torso, NEVER tank top, NEVER sleeveless, NEVER beefcake. Even cyborgs wear coats over their torso.
- NO "Mandalorian" / NO "beskar" / NO "T-visor" / NO "T-shaped visor" / NO Boba Fett / NO Star Wars (Flux renders the franchise IP)
- NO form-fitting bodyglove fashion / NO sleek runway suits / NO clean parade uniforms / NO pilot cockpit suits without armor / NO glamour kit
- NOT bulky-tank power-armor brute — this is a TACTICAL OPERATIVE / Destiny Guardian / rogue / assassin, not a Halo MJOLNIR berserker

Vary the role: bounty hunter / mercenary / planetary surveyor / EVA fieldworker / scout / marksman sniper / breacher / scavenger / cave-diver / hazmat specialist / heavy-weapons operative / cyberpunk operative / Destiny Guardian Hunter or Titan or Warlock / Mass Effect operative.

The bar: each entry should read as a Destiny Guardian, Mass Effect operative, Halo ODST, or sci-fi rogue/assassin you'd see in a hostile alien planet cinematic. Tactical + capable + stylish + COVERED. Output JSON array of strings.`;

- About 50% of entries should include head covering (helmet, hood, visor, mask, breathing apparatus); 50% should have head uncovered (hair visible, hood pulled back, helmet held in hand)

- Burgundy hooded monastic-order robe with armored undersuit, sigil-engraved chestplate
- Brass-and-rust dieselpunk explorer jacket with goggle-helmet and oversized utility bandolier

(1) Distinctive architectural shape (chrome obelisk / brutalist ziggurat / twisted spire / inverted pyramid / fractal-tiered / etc.)
(2) MASSIVE HOLOGRAPHIC ADVERTISEMENT visible on the building face — often a beautiful android/sexy fashion model/seductive geisha pitching a corporate product (sake / cybernetic upgrade / luxury fragrance / synthetic companion / etc.). Could also be a giant CEO face, propaganda banner, or animated kaiju logo — but lean into the "sexy ad" cyberpunk-trope flavor often.
(3) Dense neon signage (kanji / glyphs / brand logos / flickering tubes) wrapping or climbing the structure
(4) IMPLIED flight traffic — flight-deck balconies / anti-grav landing pads / hovering signage / drone-thoroughfares around the building

THE AESTHETIC: Blade Runner 2049's holographic Joi, Cyberpunk 2077's Lizzy Wizzy spire, Ghost in the Shell's geisha pop-up, Akira's neon-soaked apartment blocks, Fifth Element's vertical city. NEON, HOLOGRAMS, FLYING SPINNERS, DENSE.

7. Spiral neon-helix tower with projected hologram of a winking pin-up android pitching corporate cigarettes, anti-grav cargo pads at every fifth tier, ion-trail vehicles passing through helix gaps.
8. Brutalist concrete block with full-facade hologram of a swimsuit-clad android lounging on synthetic beach selling vacation memory-tourism packages, neon-kanji climbing scaffolds.
9. Crystalline modular tower with each face displaying different rotating ad-hologram (sexy android pop-star / luxury cyber-watch / synth-companion), drone delivery formations between modules.
10. Pagoda-tiered skyscraper with massive hologram of a kimono-cyborg fashion model advertising designer cyborg-cosmetics, neon-red lantern strings between every tier, hover-taxi traffic at multiple elevations.

- Cozy command bridge / cockpit (single pilot at console, warm panel glow, porthole view of stars/nebula/planet)
- Bedroom / private quarters / sleeping nook / berth / captain's cabin (hammocks, quilts, personal mementos)
- Bar / lounge / cantina / cafe / noodle joint / tea house / pub (warm intimate booths, sometimes 2-4 distant patrons)
- Lab / workshop / engineering nook / tinkerer's corner (researcher's cozy lab with porthole, specimens, plants)
- Atrium / greenhouse / hydroponics / botanical garden / arboretum / conservatory / terrarium / aquarium (lush plants, often biomech or alien biology mixed in, porthole or skylight)
- Reading nook / sitting area / study / den / library corner
- Galley / kitchen / mess hall (warm cooking, baking, dining)
- Observation deck / skybar / sky-lounge / panoramic viewport lookout / dome (BIG curved window with planet below or nebula)

- Cargo holds / cargo bays / cargo containers / storage lockers / storage closets / supply rooms
- Corridors / hallways / passages / maintenance tunnels / utility shafts / access ducts / crawlspaces
- Waiting areas / departure lounges / terminal lobbies / queue zones
- Escape pods / emergency capsules / life pods (unless converted into a fully-decorated bedroom-style nook)

- Gyms / locker rooms / showers / toilets / bathrooms / wash rooms
- War rooms / tactical centers / interrogation rooms / operating theaters
- Foundries / smelting bays / forge rooms / industrial floors / factory floors
- Memorial / shrine / temple / monastery / cult / ritual chamber spaces

━━━ THE RICH SCENE SEED FORMAT — every entry follows this EXACTLY ━━━
Each seed is 80-150 words. Use these exact slot headers (the labels themselves are part of the entry):

[NAME / TYPE] — [one-sentence headline anchor]
FOREGROUND: [specific tangible detail — railing, terrace, machinery, ruin, ridge]
MIDGROUND: [city/structure body, with scale provers named — tiny ships, lit windows, bridge traffic, smaller buildings clustered]
DEEP DISTANCE: [the hero anchor, dominant, partially veiled in atmospheric haze]
SKY: [atmospheric layer — smog, twin moons, storm, light pollution glow, ring-curve]
SCALE PROVERS: [3+ explicit small-things-prove-big-things — name them]
MATERIAL: [what surfaces are made of, how they wear, what light does to them]
EMOTIONAL DNA: [the feeling — awe, dread, wonder, melancholy, alien-indifference, sacred]

━━━ HARD RULES ━━━
- Multi-tier composition is NON-NEGOTIABLE — every seed has all 4 depth layers (FG, MG, Deep, Sky) explicitly filled
- Specific material language — ribbed obsidian over concrete (not "alien architecture"), copper-green oxide (not "weathered"), bioluminescent chitin (not "alien biology")
- 3+ named scale provers per seed — "ships as dots", "hundreds of lit windows", "figures-as-pinpricks on the bridge"
- Each seed has a DISTINCT visual DNA — no two seeds should feel interchangeable
- Architectural / biological / mechanical SPECIFICITY — name the style (brutalist / chitin-grown / cyclopean / Kirby-cosmic / etc.)
- 80-150 words per seed
- NO franchise proper nouns (no "Coruscant" / "Reaper" / "Halo" / etc. — INSPIRED BY, not literal)

━━━ FORBIDDEN — every seed must AVOID ━━━
- Generic descriptors without anchors ("vast city", "sprawling spires", "massive structure", "alien architecture") — these are placeholder noise
- The same tower-with-orange-windows-in-fog default; force variety in architectural style across seeds
- Single-hero-building isolation — every seed has supporting density
- Teal+orange default palette mention — let LIGHTING/VIBE handle palette, don't lock it in the seed

━━━ OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT ━━━

2. CANYON CITY OF SUSPENDED BRIDGES — vertical city carved into both faces of a 3-kilometer canyon, linked by 80+ suspension bridges at staggered heights, eroded stone balconies, prayer flags whipping in updraft, canyon walls weeping mineral stains.
3. (... and so on, ${count} numbered entries total)
