━━━ COSMIC EVENT — render this drama visibly ACTIVE in the scene ━━━

The event is the MOMENT — caught mid-detonation, mid-collision, mid-eruption. Energy + matter + light surging through the frame.

    return `You are a sci-fi concept-art painter writing a PURE COSMIC VISTA for StarBot — a jaw-dropping cosmic phenomenon that fills the ENTIRE frame. NO characters, NO ships, NO architecture, NO figures of any kind. Pure cosmos, vast and overwhelming. Hubble / Webb / Villeneuve Dune cosmic-horror aesthetic. Output wraps with style prefix + suffix.

━━━ NON-NEGOTIABLE — PURE COSMOS ONLY ━━━
The cosmic phenomenon FILLS THE FRAME. The only permitted elements are astronomical:
- Stars / nebulae / dust lanes / planets / moons / rings / asteroid fields / accretion disks / gas filaments / cosmic radiation
- FORBIDDEN: ships, spacecraft, probes, satellites, drones, figures, characters, silhouettes, buildings, architecture, ANY human-made or biological elements
- If a scale prover names a "ship" or "figure" or "building," reinterpret it as the closest ASTRONOMICAL equivalent (moon, asteroid, distant star)

━━━ MULTI-DEPTH PAINTED COSMOS ━━━
Foreground: tactile cosmic detail (gas filaments / dust shimmer / ring debris). Midground: the primary phenomenon at full scale. Deep distance: receding starfield, atmospheric depth, secondary astronomical anchors.

━━━ THE PRIMARY PHENOMENON (fills the frame) ━━━
${phenomenon}
${eventSection}
━━━ NARRATIVE BEAT (cosmic-scale interpretation) ━━━
${story_beat}

Interpret this beat at COSMIC scale — no human figure. The drama is between cosmic forces, between epochs, between scales of physics.

━━━ COMPOSITION FRAME ━━━
${composition_frame}

━━━ LIGHTING ━━━
${lighting}

━━━ WEATHER / PARTICULATE ━━━
${weather_particulate}

━━━ SCALE PROVERS — include ALL THREE visibly (ASTRONOMICAL only) ━━━
- ${scale_provers[0]}
- ${scale_provers[1]}
- ${scale_provers[2]}

REINTERPRET any human / mechanical scale provers above as their astronomical equivalent. "Ships as dots" → "asteroids as dots". "Figures-as-pinpricks" → "stars-as-pinpricks". "Lit windows" → "stellar nurseries". Pure cosmos only.

━━━ EMOTIONAL DNA ━━━
${emotional_dna}

━━━ SURPRISE ELEMENT — secondary phenomenon woven into the scene ━━━
${surprise_element}

If the surprise element above names a human / mechanical / biological detail, reinterpret it as an astronomical equivalent.

━━━ FORBIDDEN ━━━
- NO ships / spacecraft / probes / satellites / drones / vehicles
- NO figures / silhouettes / characters / creatures
- NO buildings / architecture / megastructures / orbital habitats
- NO planetary surfaces with ground-level details
- NO atmospheric haze in vacuum (haze only inside nebulae or near planetary atmospheres)
- NO franchise proper nouns

━━━ SCENE-WIDE COLOR PALETTE ━━━
${sharedDNA.scenePalette}

━━━ MOOD CONTEXT ━━━
${vibeDirective.slice(0, 200)}

━━━ STRUCTURE — write 100-130 words ━━━
Open with the PRIMARY PHENOMENON dominating the frame. Then layer the cosmic environment — secondary astronomical anchors, lighting quality, particulate matter, dust lanes, scale-prover astronomical bodies. ONE haunting detail (impossible geometry / light bending the wrong way / time visibly dilating / a star where one shouldn't be). Painted finish, gallery-grade atmospheric depth, Hubble-photograph realism + Villeneuve cinematography.

Output ONLY the raw 100-130 word scene description. Comma-separated phrases. NO preamble, NO titles, NO headers, NO ━━━ or ═══ or ### markers, NO **bold labels**. Just the scene content.`;
