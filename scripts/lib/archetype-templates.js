━━━ NON-NEGOTIABLE — NEVER A SINGLE HERO BUILDING ━━━

━━━ THE CITY ━━━
${setting}

Render with multi-tier vertical density. Foreground: tactile detail near the camera (terrace edge / antenna array / cable / rooftop garden). Midground: city body with hundreds of windows, multiple towers, bridges connecting at various heights, traffic between.

━━━ INSIDE THE CITY, ALIVE WITH ACTIVITY — NON-NEGOTIABLE ━━━
The frame is INSIDE the city — wide-angle views looking DOWN a busy avenue, looking UP between towers, on a balcony or skybridge overlooking the throng, in a busy market plaza, in a transport hub. NOT distant skyline shots where the city is small in the frame surrounded by terrain — the city FILLS the frame.

The city is ALIVE WITH COMMOTION:
- Multiple ships of varying sizes flying between buildings at different elevations — small commuter craft, mid-size freighters, large transports
- Traffic visible on multi-tier skyways / skybridges / elevated rails
- Holographic signage and billboards flickering, advertising in unknown alien glyphs
- Smaller drones, hover-vehicles, and commerce in motion at street level
- Hundreds of pinprick lit windows speckling every tower face
- Light pollution from a thousand sources cutting through atmospheric haze
- Steam vents, signal beacons, spotlight beams visible
- Tiny figures populating bridges and balconies (proving the city is INHABITED)

This is a BUSY metropolis at work, not a quiet diorama. The atmosphere should feel like being immersed in a great alien capital.

The city is ALIVE. Tiny ships threading between towers, light glowing from windows at multiple elevations, holographic signage flickering, atmospheric haze separating depth bands. Never a static lifeless diorama.

━━━ FORBIDDEN ━━━

━━━ NON-NEGOTIABLE — CHARACTER MUST BE VISIBLE ━━━
EXACTLY ONE character is visibly rendered in the frame at MEDIUM-LARGE anchor scale (20-40% of frame height) — off-center at rule-of-thirds position, NOT centered portrait, NOT a tiny dot. Face partially visible (3/4 profile or side-lit). Helmets have visor up or transparent. Without the character the render fails — the character is the focal point even though the scene wraps them.

━━━ SOLO CHARACTER ONLY ━━━
EXACTLY ONE figure. No companions, no enemies, no crowds. This figure ALONE in their cosmic moment.

━━━ NON-NEGOTIABLE — MULTI-TIER PAINTED SCENE ━━━
Foreground: tactile detail (rock edge / mist / shimmer / glyph). Midground: THE CHARACTER, off-center, mid-action. Deep distance: the cosmic environment receding into atmospheric haze and impossibly-scaled astronomical anchors.

Interpret this beat at COSMIC scale as a moment of AWESOMENESS / WONDER / TRANSCENDENCE for the character — discovery, communion, mastery, witness to the sublime.

━━━ STRUCTURE — write 110-140 words ━━━
OPEN WITH THE CHARACTER. The first 25-30 words name the figure (species / gear / wardrobe / face partially visible) and the action they are mid-performing.

━━━ HARD FRAMING RULES (non-negotiable) ━━━
- The character is OFF-CENTER at rule-of-thirds position — body anchored to the left third OR right third of the frame, never centered.
- The character occupies 20-35% of the frame — NOT a centered portrait closeup, NOT a face-fills-the-frame headshot, NOT a beauty shot.
- The remaining 65-80% of the frame is the COSMIC ENVIRONMENT — name AT LEAST THREE specific scene-depth elements visible around them (a distant astronomical anchor, a midground architectural feature, a foreground tactile detail).
- The viewer can see the character's body language AND the scene wrapping them simultaneously.

After opening with the character: paint the cosmic environment wrapping them — atmosphere, lighting, sky, deep-distance anchors, midground forms, foreground texture.

━━━ EMBRACE THE SURREAL — DREAMLIKE IMPOSSIBLE WONDER ━━━
The scene should feel DREAMLIKE, SURREAL, IMPOSSIBLE — but in an "oh WOW" direction, not an "oh no" direction. Lean into anatomical and physical strangeness pointed at WONDER:
- Figure proportions IMPOSSIBLY-ELONGATED or IMPOSSIBLY-STRETCHED by gravitational tides — body warped beautifully, not injured
- Helmet / mask OVERSIZED / CRYSTALLINE / IRIDESCENT — strange anatomy in service of mysticism, not horror
- Figure FLOATING / DRIFTING / HOVERING with no clear gravity — physics dreamlike, not falling
- Light bending the WRONG WAY but BEAUTIFULLY (starlight curving around the figure, shadows pointing wrong-but-magical)
- TIME-DILATED frozen moment — figure caught mid-blink of revelation, edges shimmering, particles suspended
- IMPOSSIBLE SCALE — figure dwarfed by cosmic phenomenon, in awe not in fear
- ONE haunting-but-WONDROUS detail — a fractal pattern in their armor, a halo of impossible light, stars arranging into a sigil only they can see

The vibe: David Bowman in 2001's Beyond the Infinite. Major Tom drifting in awe. The Star-Child. Annihilation's Shimmer-touched figures. Surreal-transcendent, not surreal-doomed.

━━━ POSITIVE TWIST ONLY (non-negotiable) ━━━
The character is ALIVE and AWED — never dying, never collapsed, never wounded, never decayed, never fatalistic. The dreamlike-impossible quality applies to their PROPORTIONS / POSE / RELATIONSHIP TO GRAVITY / RELATIONSHIP TO LIGHT — never to their vitality. "Oh wow what is happening to this person" should feel like AWE, not pity.

The character is the subject. The cosmos is the stage. The strangeness is the magic. If the result is either (a) a normal-proportions action-pose character OR (b) a fatalistic / dying / wounded figure, the prompt fails.
